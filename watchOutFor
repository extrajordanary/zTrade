/**  Flight Control **/

- Bonus star for the ability to listen to your own music during the game. I wish more games supported this, as canned soundtracks get old quickly.

- My only gripe is that each type of plane enters the screen from one of a few pre-determined locations. It would be nice (but more difficult) to be able to have any plane enter from any position randomly.

- Version 1.1 adds some location based leaderboards and the welcome ability to save the game state if you close the app or get a phone call.

- The bad is that the difficulty level is surprisingly high. It's made worse by offscreen planes spawning in right next to existing planes. There's little the player can do about that. It would have been better to prevent new planes from spawning so close new planes that are already in play.

- And unfortunately there's a frustrating interaction with notification center. Any top-to-bottom swipe in the upper part of the screen brings down notification center and pauses the game. Ugh. It's still worth playing, even though this is major blemish on a nicely designed game.

- Finally, there are some planes which can't be directed and this adds more dimension. 

- planes entering the airspace will often appear on top of other existing planes creating an impossible to avoid crash. This shortens the game unnecessarily. 

- the optional slide down screen is easily and routinely unintentionally accessed through the gameplay. It's a huge annoyance for an unnecessary extra.
